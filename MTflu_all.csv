"The columns and rows are the counties. Column A is the independent counties. In my example I focused on county 4. Since counties 1 through 4 are not neighbors they get a 0. County 46 is a neighbor so it's entry should be the population of county 46 divided by the sum of the populations of 4 and 46. When we get to county 46 in the rows, its entry for 4 would be the population of 4 divided by the sum of the populations 4 and 46. ",,,,,,
